  "bio": "I first came to UVU thinking I wanted to graduate with a degree in Physics.  I decided that research and stuff wasn't for me, so I decided to take a more practical approach with Engineering.  I soon found out that I absolutely loved my CS classes, so I changed my major to computer science.  I was a bit overwhelemed at the beginning of a semester, so I switched to Digital Media with an emphasis in Internet Technologies.  I love coding!"
